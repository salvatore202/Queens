# Queens - N-Queens Problem Solutions
Welcome to the Queens repository! Here you will find an implementation to solve the classic N-Queens Problem, which consists of placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The problem is solved using a search and exploration approach.
