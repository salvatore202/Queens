# **Queens - N-Queens Problem Solutions**

Welcome to the Queens repository! Here you will find an implementation to solve the classic **N-Queens Problem**, which consists of placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The problem is solved using a **search and exploration** approach.

## **Repository Contents üìÇ**

This repository includes:

- **Main Algorithm**: A C++ implementation of the **Backtracking** algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem.
- **Supporting Files**: Additional files required to run the program.

## **How to Compile and Run üõ†Ô∏è**

If you want to compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as g++ (part of GCC).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salvatore202/Queens.git
   cd Queens
